```

Or run with the UI for live feedback:

```bash

```

Deployed on **Vercel**  
Build command: `npm run build`

## ðŸ“„ Notes

- UI implementation is based on the provided design mockups.
- Some data like **testimonials** was not available in the API, so static dummy data was used instead.
- The **countdown timer** shows negative values because the API returns a scholarship start date in the past (2020).
- Tested and confirmed working on latest Chrome and Safari.
